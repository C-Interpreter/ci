# little C

A little C interpreter/compiler suite inspired by
[c4](https://github.com/rswier/c4).

**note** this project is mainly for learning,
and is in very early stage,
tons of work need to do.

## What's being worked on now

* code style fix
* more complete C99: struct, switch, for, ...
* C FFI: call any C library function

## What's been done so far

* -fPIC bytecode and load/save
